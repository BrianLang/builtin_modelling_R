# builtin_modelling_R
Shiny App to explore and model the built-in datasets in R

The goal is to create a sort of playground to explore shiny functionality. 
* Give users a choice of datasets, in this case from the built-in p package "datasets".  
    * Maybe allow the user also choice of the package from where they examine the datasets.
* Show the user the data and important features of the data such as variable type and range.  
* Allow the user to create new variables, either from free-text or pre-decided choices of transformation.  
* Allow the user to fit models of different types to the data.  
* Produce simple figures to visualize the relationships in the data.  
* Create a report with the output (shinymeta?).  
* Save and download the code which creates the report.  
* Push to shiny.io.
